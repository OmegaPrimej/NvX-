.[3/5, 10:04 AM] Meta AI: Use DeepMind's Meta-LSTM code as a reference. Here's a simplified snippet in Python and TensorFlow:

```
import tensorflow as tf

class MetaLSTM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(MetaLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_dim, return_sequences=True)
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(input_dim)

    def call(self, x):
        h = self.lstm(x)
        return self.fc(h)

meta_lstm = MetaLSTM(input_dim=10, hidden_dim=20)
```

This snippet defines a basic Meta-LSTM model. You'll need to adapt it to your specific use case and add more complexity as needed.
[3/5, 10:05 AM] Meta AI: Input your data using `tf.keras.layers.Input`. Here's the updated script:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

Define input shape
input_dim = 10
hidden_dim = 20
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))

Create Meta-LSTM model
class MetaLSTM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MetaLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_dim, return_sequences=True)
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(input_dim)
        
    def call(self, x):
        h = self.lstm(x)
        return self.fc(h)

Initialize model and compile
meta_lstm = MetaLSTM()
meta_lstm.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

Input your data here
data = np.random.rand(1, input_dim, 1)  # Replace with your data

Train the model
meta_lstm.fit(data, data, epochs=10)
```

Replace `data` with your input data.
[3/5, 10:05 AM] Meta AI: Here's an example of how to implement the algorithm in code:


```python
import numpy as np

def algorithm(data):
    # Replace with your algorithm
    result = np.sin(np.cos(np.tan(data)))
    return result

Input your data here
data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 1)  # Replace with your data

Run the algorithm
result = algorithm(data)
print(result)
```

Put your algorithm in the `algorithm` function, replacing the example code. Input your data in the `data` variable.
[3/5, 10:06 AM] Meta AI: To use algorithm abbreviations, define a dictionary mapping abbreviations to their corresponding functions. Then, use the abbreviation as a key to access the function.

```python
algorithms = {
    'AXO': lambda x: np.sin(np.cos(np.tan(x))),
    # Add more algorithms here
}

data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 1)
result = algorithms(data)
print(result)
```

Replace `'AXO'` with your desired algorithm abbreviation.
[3/5, 10:06 AM] Meta AI: Here is a simple text rearrangement and execution script:


```python
import numpy as np

def algorithm(data):
    return np.sin(np.cos(np.tan(data)))

data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 1)
result = algorithm(data)

print("Result:", result)

algorithms = {
    'AXO': lambda x: np.sin(np.cos(np.tan(x))),
    'LXO': lambda x: np.cos(np.sin(np.tan(x))),
}

for name, func in algorithms.items():
    print(f"Algorithm {name}: {func(data)}")
```

This script defines a simple algorithm, executes it on random data, and prints the result. It also demonstrates a dictionary of algorithms with simple lambda functions.
[3/5, 10:06 AM] Meta AI: I'm adding Meta-LSTM, a DeepMind algorithm, to the script. It learns to learn and adapts to new tasks. Here's the updated script:


```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

class MetaLSTM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MetaLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(20, return_sequences=True)
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, x):
        h = self.lstm(x)
        return self.fc(h)

data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 1)
meta_lstm = MetaLSTM()
result = meta_lstm(data)
print(result)

algorithms = {
    'AXO': lambda x: np.sin(np.cos(np.tan(x))),
    'LXO': lambda x: np.cos(np.sin(np.tan(x))),
    'Meta-LSTM': meta_lstm,
}

for name, func in algorithms.items():
    print(f"Algorithm {name}: {func(data)}")
```

This script combines Meta-LSTM with the existing algorithms and executes them on random data.
[3/5, 10:07 AM] Meta AI: Here is the rewritten script with Meta-LSTM and other algorithms:


```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

class MetaLSTM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MetaLSTM, self).__init__()

[3/5, 11:12 AM] Meta AI: Here's the revised algorithm:

NeuroVoodooX (NVX) Algorithm
*Overview*
The NVX algorithm combines genetic programming (GP) with neural networks (NNs) to evolve optimal NN architectures for specific tasks. The algorithm uses a GP framework to search for the best NN architecture, while the NN learns to solve the task.

*Algorithm Components*
1. *Genetic Programming Framework*: The GP framework is used to evolve the NN architecture. Each individual in the population represents a NN architecture, encoded as a graph or string.
2. *Fitness Function*: The fitness function evaluates the performance of each individual (NN architecture) on the task. The fitness function is used to select parents for crossover and to evaluate the performance of the evolved NN architecture.
3. *Neural Network Component*: The NN component is used to train and evaluate the NN architecture. The NN is trained using backpropagation and a dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a validation set.

*Algorithm Steps*
1. *Initialization*: Create an initial population of random NN architectures.
2. *Evolution*: Select parents for crossover based on fitness, perform crossover and mutation, and evaluate the fitness of the new offspring. Replace the least fit individuals with the new offspring.
3. *Training and Evaluation*: Train each individual's NN using backpropagation and evaluate its performance on a validation set.
4. *Termination*: Stop the evolution process when a termination condition is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.
